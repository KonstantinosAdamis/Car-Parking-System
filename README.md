# Car-Parking-Sensor
A Car Parking Sensor with Arduino UNO R3

For this project you will need 1 Arduino UNO R3, 1 Piezo Buzzer, 1 Ultrasonic Sensor, 1 LED and 1 220 Î© Resistor.

The sensor helps the driver from having an accident with an object (e.g. wall) during the parking process.

ðŸŽ¯ How This Works:

âœ… 10 Grades (0-400 cm, 40 cm per grade)

âœ… LED & buzzer turn ON and OFF together

âœ… Beep & Blink get faster as object gets closer

âœ… Works up to 400+ cm smoothly
