# Car-Parking-Sensor
A Car Parking Sensor with Arduino UNO R3

The sensor helps the driver from having an accident with an object (e.g. a wall) during the parking process.

ðŸŽ¯ How This Works:

âœ… 10 Grades (0-400 cm, 40 cm per grade)

âœ… LED & buzzer turn ON and OFF together

âœ… Beep & Blink get faster as object gets closer

âœ… Works up to 400+ cm smoothly
